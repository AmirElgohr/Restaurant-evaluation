        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Dine Chat may collect the following information from users of our application: first name, last name, street
            address, area and city, phone and contact numbers, email address, GPS location (mobile application)
            (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII")
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Dine Chat may collect information regarding users' past orders, favorite venues, customer
            service
            inquiries, service reviews, and certain preferences related to social networking (e.g., pages you "Like" or
            "Recommend").
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also use web analytics software to track and analyze traffic in connection with Dine Chat advertising
            and
            promotion of services. We may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including
            PII.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or "Non-PII") is aggregated information, demographic information,
            and
            any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third-party service providers
            may
            collect Non-PII, including your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser,
            and
            demographic data like location, gender, and date of birth. We and our service providers may use cookies,
            pixel
            tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to serve you with tailored information and facilitate your
            ongoing use of our Application. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most
            browsers allow you to decline the use of cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            IP Addresses are automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). We log IP
            Addresses along with visit times and pages visited for site usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and
            administering the site.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Your Informatio</h2>
        <p>
            Dine Chat uses PII to create user accounts, communicate about services, offer additional services,
            promotions,
            special offers, and charge for purchases. Users can opt-out of receiving promotional communications. We
            enforce
            our terms of use and service through the use of PII.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use cookies for site recognition and enhancing user experience. We do not sell the information we collect
            to
            third parties. However, we share collected PII with third-party vendors and service providers for APIs and
            functions related to service delivery. We also disclose PII to restaurants for order processing and may
            disclose
            it to legal authorities in connection with law enforcement requests or legal claims.

        <p>
            Since Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose and share it
            with
            affiliates and third parties. If we combine Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated as
            PII
            for as long as it remains combined.

            site.
            We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose PII, except
            where
            required to do otherwise under applicable law.
